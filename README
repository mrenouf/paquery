A simple tool to query various object names from PulseAudio.

Things that can be queried are: devices, sinks, sources, and clients.
Filtering can be done using a set of properties (name/value pairs).

I wrote this tool to use in conjunction with pacmd in writing scripts 
to automate various audio configuration changes.

I hope you find it useful as well!

=======

Usage: paquery [options] [card|sink|source] [<propery=value> ...]

Options:
    -v       Verbose: list all properties for each match

Query Type (exactly one required):
    card     List name of matching cards
    sink     List name of matching sinks
    source   List name of matching sources

The remainder of the arguments are taken as name-value pairs
which must be separated by an equals sign. If the value contains,
spaces, it must be quoted to be considered a single value.
