A simple tool to query various object names from PulseAudio.

Things that can be queried are: devices, sinks, sources, and clients.
Filtering can be done using a set of properties (name/value pairs).

I wrote this tool to use in conjunction with pacmd in writing scripts 
to automate various audio configuration changes.

I hope you find it useful as well!

=======
Usage: paquery [options] [query_type] [<propery=value> ...]

Options:
    -v       Verbose: list all properties for each match
    -n       Numeric: print indexes instead of names

Query Type (exactly one required):
    module          List matching modules
    client          List matching clients
    card            List matching cards
    sink            List matching sinks
    source          List matching sources
    sink-input      List matching sink-inputs
    source-output   List matching source-outputs

The remainder of the arguments are taken as name-value pairs
which must be separated by an equals sign. If the value contains,
spaces, it must be quoted to be considered a single value.
